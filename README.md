# 1.Child-Sponsorship-CRM
Project Overview: Child Sponsorship CRM is a Salesforce-based solution designed for nonprofit organizations to manage sponsor contributions, track child development updates, and generate impact reports. This project enables NGOs to strengthen donor relationships, ensure transparency in sponsorship programs, and provide real-time insights into sponsored children’s progress.

# Child Sponsorship CRM
# Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis
Non-profit organizations that run child sponsorship programs often struggle with managing sponsor contributions, keeping track of child development data, and providing impact updates to donors. Using spreadsheets or manual systems can lead to delays, errors, and lack of trust. A centralized CRM solution can help ensure transparency, automate communication, and improve donor engagement while tracking the holistic development of children.

# Requirement Gathering
• Record sponsor details and their recurring contributions
• Maintain child profiles with demographics, education, health, and development updates
• Link sponsors with children they support and track sponsorship history
• Automate reminders for due contributions and thank-you emails for payments received
• Generate impact reports showing how funds are being utilized
• Dashboards for NGOs to view contribution trends and child development status

# Stakeholder Analysis
• Sponsors: Contribute funds, receive regular updates, and view impact reports
• NGO Staff: Manage sponsor-child relationships, update child records, track funds
• Children (indirect beneficiaries): Receive support in education, health, and development
• System Administrator: Manage data accuracy, troubleshoot issues, maintain security
• NGO Management: Monitor contribution flows, donor engagement, and overall program impact

# Business Process Mapping
Sponsor signs up → Sponsorship linked to child → Contribution made → Automated acknowledgement sent → NGO updates child development progress → Impact report generated → Donor receives updates

# Possible exceptions:
Missed contributions, sponsor-child reassignment, late impact reporting

# Industry-Specific Use Case Analysis
