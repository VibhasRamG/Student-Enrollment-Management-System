# Stakeholder Analysis
• Admissions Officer: Manage applications, review documents, approve or reject enrollments.
• Students/Applicants: Submit applications, upload documents, receive updates and notifications.
• Academic Staff: Access enrolled student data for academic planning.
• System Administrator: Oversee the entire process, manage users, and ensure data accuracy.
• Institution Management: Monitor enrollment statistics and make strategic decisions.

# Business Process Mapping
Application submitted → Document verification → Application review → Approval/rejection decision → Enrollment confirmation → Student added to academic database → Welcome and orientation communication sent → Reports generated for insights.

# Possible exceptions:
Incomplete applications, missing documents, late submissions, or withdrawal before enrollment.

# Industry-Specific Use Case Analysis

# Project Overview
Many educational institutions face difficulties in keeping track of student internship activities. Managing internship details through spreadsheets or manual methods leads to data loss, delays in progress reporting, and lack of visibility into student performance.This Salesforce application will centralize internship data, automate task reminders, and generate insights through dashboards. It will also serve as a proof of real-time application of Salesforce for education-related use cases.

# Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis
• Colleges and universities must ensure students complete mandatory internships before graduation, but there is no streamlined system to track internship allocations, progress, and outcomes.
