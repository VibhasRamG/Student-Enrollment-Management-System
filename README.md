# 1.Corporate-Training-CRM
Project Overview: Corporate Training CRM is a Salesforce-based solution designed to help organizations manage and track employee training programs, skill progress, certifications, and feedback. This project enables HR managers to assign training, employees to track their progress, and management to analyze overall skill development using dashboards and reports.

# Corporate Training CRM
# Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis
Many organizations struggle to track employee training, certifications, and skill development in a structured way. Training progress is often scattered across emails, spreadsheets, and paper certificates, leading to poor visibility, compliance risks, and lack of accountability. A centralized CRM solution can standardize the process, ensure timely completion of training, and improve workforce skills efficiently.

# Requirement Gathering
• Maintain employee training profiles with skill details and assigned training programs
• Assign training modules with start and end dates, trainers, and prerequisites
• Track completion status and store earned certifications
• Collect employee feedback and trainer evaluations after each session
• Automate reminder emails for upcoming or pending training
• Generate dashboards showing training completion rate, skills coverage, and feedback scores

# Stakeholder Analysis
• Employees: View assigned training, update progress, submit feedback
• Trainers: Conduct training sessions, mark attendance, provide evaluations
• HR/Training Manager: Assign training, track progress, ensure compliance
• System Administrator: Manage users, maintain data integrity, troubleshoot issues
• Organization Management: View training analytics, skill gap analysis, and ROI

# Business Process Mapping
Training assigned → Employee attends session → Progress updated → Certification uploaded → Feedback collected → Completion confirmed → Dashboards updated with analytics

# Possible exceptions:
Employee misses session, trainer reschedules/cancels session, delayed certification uploads

# Industry-Specific Use Case Analysis
• IT Companies: Track technical certifications, cloud platform training
• Manufacturing Companies: Manage safety compliance and machinery training
• Corporate Enterprises: Upskill workforce through leadership and communication training
